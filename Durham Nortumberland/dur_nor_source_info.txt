in galbi_dur_nor_raw.txt

The data we compiled by John Galbi (https://www.galbithink.org/names/engb1800.htm) from George Bellâ€™s parish marriage register transcriptions for Northumberland and Durham. Fields: rn, placeid (see file names in source directories), year (of marriage), gname-r, gname, sex.

As with the the Scotland data, the records were preprocessed to standardise alternate spellings of the smae name (e.g. Ann / Anne / Hanna) and to remove obvious bynames that had been mistranscribed as prefix-names (e.g. females named McVey). 

The raw and preprocessed data are in the files
