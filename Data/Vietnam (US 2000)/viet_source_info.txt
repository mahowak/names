To make our estimate of the distribution of Vietnamese first (family) names in the US US 2000 census 2000, we first compiled a master list of names. To make this, two lists of frequent Vietnamese first (family) names (Lauderdale, & Kestenbaum, 2000; Taylor, Nguyen, Do, Li, & Yasui, 2011) were combined with a Vietnamese names list from Wikipedea. 


The frequencies for these names in the population reporting as Asian in the US 2000 census (in US FAM 2000.csv) were then calculated.

Original data is in viet usa 2000.xlsx
